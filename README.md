This repository is a collection of automation projects developed using both Java (for GUI and event-driven logic) and MATLAB (for complex physical simulations and mathematical modeling).
Examples of projects: Interactive Traffic Light (GUI), PIN-based Access Control System and a Pool game that simulates the collision and movement of billiard balls on a table, using position vectors and friction forces to render realistic behavior.
